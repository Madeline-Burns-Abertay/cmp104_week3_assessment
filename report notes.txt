step 1: try three j loops inside the i loop
step 2: realise you're being an idiot
step 3: try two loops from 1 to height
step 4: goto 2
step 5: correct the inner loop to be from 1 to 2*height
step 6: if j isn't in the range height Â± i, set output char to space, otherwise set it to (temp value - will be corrected later) j - i; output char at end of inner loop and endl at end of outer loop

step 7: after moving from library to 4506 due to time, realise a single if/else won't cut it
step 8: nest another if inside the else block; add 0x30 to char at end of else block so it shows as a digit
step 9: for now, if j > height, set output char to 0
step 10: otherwise, set output char to (i - height) + j (see figure 2 for reasoning)

step 11: correct value of char if j > height - set it to height + i - j
